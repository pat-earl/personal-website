        <h4>Computer Science Instructor</h4>

        <hr>

        <p>
            Currently I am instructor at Kutztown University of PA.
            This web page isn't updated
            frequently, so refer to my faculty webpage <a href="https://csit.kutztown.edu/~earl">here</a>,
            for more up to date stuff (Webpage is down due to Log4J :-( )
            
            <br>Basic information about me:<br><br>
            I received my B.S. ('18) and M.S. ('19) 
            in Computer Science from Kutztown University and have been teaching
            there since August 2019.<br>
            My free time is spent playing video games, <a href="images/motorcycle.png">riding my motorcycle</a>, hiking, 
            and spending time with my cat, <a href="images/roger.jpg">Roger</a>.

            <br><br>
            I am by no means a web-design expert, so please excuse this basic website :-)
